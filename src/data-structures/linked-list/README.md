# ðŸš€ðŸš€What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure which looks like a chain of nodes. Where each node is a different element. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location.

It is basically chains of nodes, each node contains information such as data and a pointer to the next node in the chain. In the linked list there is a head pointer, which points to the first element of the linked list, and if the list is empty then it simply points to null or nothing.

# ðŸš€ðŸš€Why linked list data structure needed?
Here are a few advantages of a linked list that is listed below, it will help you understand why it is necessary to know.
- **Dynamic Data structure**: The size of memory can be allocated or de-allocated at run time based on the operation insertion or deletion.
- **Ease of Insertion/Deletion**: The insertion and deletion of elements are simpler than arrays since no elements need to be shifted after insertion and deletion, Just the address needed to be updated.
- **Efficient Memory Utilization**: As we know Linked List is a dynamic data structure the size increases or decreases as per the requirement so this avoids the wastage of memory.
- **Implementation**: Various advanced data structures can be implemented using a linked list like a stack, queue, graph, hash maps, etc.

# âž¡âž¡Types of linked lists: 
There are mainly three types of linked lists:
  * [Singly Linked List](./singly-linked-list)
  * [Doubly Linked List](./doubly-linked-list)
  * Circular Linked List
